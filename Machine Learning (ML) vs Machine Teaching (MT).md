# Machine Learning (ML) vs Machine Teaching (MT)

Machine Learning uses computer algorithms to train a model based on existing scenarios. 

Machine teaching designs the optimal training data to drive the learning algorithm to a target model.

Lets take an example and understand each of it in detail. 

Lets imagine you would like to train a 5 year old to play badminton. We imagine that the girl doesn't know anything about badminton but want to give her best to understand the game and learn it. 


**Machine Learning**: You'll make the girl watch videos, see pictures of players playing badminton of her age and more, read books on Badminton etc. 
Machine learning focuses on creating an optimal training set that can guide a learning algorithm efficiently. 
Explicit instructions are given to train a model.

**Machine Teaching**: You'll actually take the girl to badminton court, train her to hold the bat, teach her how to focus on the target, run around the court, tell her the rules of play etc. 
Machine teaching uses computer algorithms, statistics to train the models to perform tasks. 
Explicit instructions are not given in performing a task.
