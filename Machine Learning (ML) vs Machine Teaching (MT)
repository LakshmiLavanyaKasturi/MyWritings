# Machine Learning (ML) vs Machine Teaching (MT)

Machine Learning uses computer algorithms to train a model based on existing scenarios. 

Machine teaching designs the optimal training data to drive the learning algorithm to a target model.

Lets take an example and understand each of it in detail. 

Lets imagine you would like to train a 5 year old to play badminton. We imagine that the girl doesn't know anything about badminton but want to give her best to understand the game and learn it. 


Machine Learning: You'll make the girl watch videos, see the pictures of players playing badminton of her age and more, read books on Badminton etc.
